# Video Game Reviews Platform

This is a social network (Metacritic Clone) for people who like games where users can upload reviews of their favorite games,
comment and interact with other users. Also everyone who visit the page can search for games information.

Stack:
Backend : SpringBoot + MySQL, Python was used with scrapy

Frontend: Angular (soon...)

I used Python Scrapy to scrape information about all the video games from the Best Games of all time section of Metacritic's website.
I then manipulated this data to generate a JSON file that is used to insert all the games information into a database using Springboot Rest API.
